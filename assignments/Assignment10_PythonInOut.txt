Task: write a new or modify an old python program to read in a tab delimited text file and write out a subset of the data to a new file using the open() command
Submit the script to me as LastName_Assign10.txt (you'll need to save it as .py to run but rename to .txt to attach to email) as well as the resulting output of your script and any input entered (in the body of your email)
