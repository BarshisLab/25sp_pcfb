Task:
	1. Create an automated shell script called ProteinParser.sh that:
		a. downloads Uniprot protein data into individual files
# Mac
curl "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A023IWG[0-3].txt" -o A0A023IWG#1.txt
curl "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A023IWE[1-3].txt" -o A0A023IWE#1.txt
# Windows git bash
curl "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A023IWG[0-3].txt" -O
curl "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A023IWE[1-3].txt" -O
		b. greps the following lines for each file:
			1. Organism (hint OS)
			2. Interpro information
			3. GO category
		c. prints those results to the screen
	2. execute the script and copy/paste the results (not the curl output just the grep outputs) into a .txt file called LastName_Assign5_output.txt
	3. submit your script and your output to me via email as LastName_Assign5_ProteinParser.sh

Bonus:
	Think about you might add in some "echo" statements in before/after/between your grep commands to make it really easy to cut/paste the output into a text editor and do a quick regex to get it into a tab-delimited table format
	Hint: use echo to add:
		a. the file names
		b. some unique string to use later in regex to add in line breaks between "rows" (e.g. "XXXX")

Bonus bonus:
	append the "grep" output in your script to a separate output file
